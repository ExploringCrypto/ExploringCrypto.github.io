![Introductory Post](/assets/images/2022/firstPost/i1.png)

Hello everyone! I created this website in order to document my cryptography learning journey. I started learning how to code in around July 2020. After creating some random projects, I stumbled upon the beautiful world of cryptography. I found asymmetric key systems like RSA and Elliptic Curves to be really fascinating. However, I lacked the foundational mathematical knowledge and maturity to truly understand what was going on. It doesn't help that I am terrified of maths :P

In order to counteract this, I have decided to start from the basics (I am in high school when this post was written). I have decided to start learning the basics of linear algebra and abstract algebra. I will first go through the book "Elementary Linear Algebra, 11<sup>th</sup> edition (Applications Version)" by Howard Anton and Chris Rorres. After that, I will be exploring the book "Learning Modern Algebra - From Early Attemps to Prove Fermat's Last Theorem" by Al Cuoco and Joseph J. Rotman.

My main objective is to truly understand how and why the mathematics behind cryptography works. I really want to get an intuitive feel for such systems. Other motivations include improving my programming skills by learning functional programming and learning how Sage (a computer algebra system works). A true test of whether I understood certain aspects of cryptography is by applying it.

This could include implementing algorithms outlined in research papers, attacking cryptographic systems in CTF challenges (a type of cybersecurity competition), implementing an algorithm myself etc. Finally, I checked out this website called [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/) which seems like a really fun way of learning how modern cryptographic systems and attacks on such systems work. My aim is to start solving the challenges and hopefully to try to solve all of them after going through the aforementioned two books.

The world of cryptography is fascinating and limitless. Time to explore :)
